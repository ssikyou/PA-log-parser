1. Usage:
	PAlogparser [--line=n] [--debug] [--quite] </path/to/csvfile>
arguments:
	csvfile: csv file path
options:
	--debug: print debug messages to log.txt
	--quite: only print error messages to log.txt
	--line: only parse first n lines, if not set, all lines will be parsed
Example:
	PAlogparser -q test.csv

2. How to compile
	make clean && make

3. Configuration:
	Default config file is "parser.conf".
	a. groups for generating excels
		There are some groups in the file, such as "Sector Distribution", "Command Distribution". A group represents an excel file which shows the statistics info. 
		The configurations under a group will affect excel generationg progress. "file_name_suffix" defines the output excel file name suffix. "x_steps" defines execl chart's x axis value's step, unit is microsecond(us).
			e.g. for Write Busy Distribution, if the x_step is 20us, then x axis will be like "[0~20), [20~40), ..., [180~200), ...", for each write request, we will calculate the max busy time and detemine which busy range it falls on.
		If you want to caculate write busy distribution, the csv file must contain BUSY event, otherwise the excel will not generate.
		If you want to caculate read latency distribution, the csv file must contain DATA event, otherwise the excel will not generate.

	b. groups for generating script
		config for cypress script:
		pattern_type=0					#0 random data, 1 user pattern, 2 int increase, 3 int decrease, 4 from log
		pattern_data="UserPatternData"	#user data pattern.
		pattern_len=15					#user pattern data len
		start_value=100					#use for int inc or int dec
		block_size=512
		max_sectors=128					#max sectors per request, if biger than this value it will be divided to several requests. 
		host_io=1						#1 1bit, 4 4bit, 8 8bit
		data_rate=0						#0 sdr, 1 ddr
		init_clk=2000					#init state clock
		usr_clk=40000					#user space clock,it will use this clock after enter transfer mode and change bus mode. 
		self_div=1						#0, divided it by this parser tool, 1 divided it use LargeRW command.
		comp_mask=320					#0x140 command response compare mask.
		curr_state=0					#0 idle, 1 ready, 2 ident, 3 stby, 4 tran, 5 data, 6 btst, 7 rcv, 8 prg, 9 dis, 10 ina, 11 slp, 12 irq, only 0 and 4 is used for select clock.
		comp_filt=1						#0 not filt, 1 filt, bit0 resp crc error
		cmd_filt=3						#0 not filt, 1 filt, bit0 filt illegal cmd between cmd0 and cmd1, bit1 filt no response cmd, bit2 filt bus_test cmd, bit3 filt tuning cmd

4. Output files:
	log.txt contains debug info.
	Excels will be generated in out directory.
	script file and bin files for write will be generated in result directory

5. Current support features:
	a. generate "Busy/Latency Distribution" excel, including cmd25, cmd24, cmd18, cmd17, cmd6
	b. generate "Command Distribution" excel
	c. generate "Sector Distribution" excel, including cmd25, cmd18
	d. generate "Address Distribution" excel, including cmd25, cmd18
	e. generate "Request Idle Distribution" excel
	f. generate "Seq Throughput" excel, including cmd25, cmd24, cmd18, cmd17
	g. generate cypress script files.
