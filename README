1. Usage:
	PAlogparser [--line=n] [--debug] [--quite] </path/to/csvfile>
arguments:
	csvfile: csv file path
options:
	--debug: print debug messages to log.txt
	--quite: only print error messages to log.txt
	--line: only parse first n lines, if not set, all lines will be parsed
Example:
	PAlogparser -q test.csv

2. How to compile
	make clean && make

3. Configuration:
	Default config file is "parser.conf".

	a. groups for generating excels
		There are some groups in the file, such as "Sector Distribution", "Command Distribution". A group represents an excel file which shows the statistics info. 
		The configurations under a group will affect excel generationg progress. "file_name_suffix" defines the output excel file name suffix. "x_steps" defines execl chart's x axis value's step, unit is microsecond(us).
			e.g. for Write Busy Distribution, if the x_step is 20us, then x axis will be like "[0~20), [20~40), ..., [180~200), ...", for each write request, we will calculate the max busy time and detemine which busy range it falls on.
		If you want to caculate write busy distribution, the csv file must contain BUSY event, otherwise the excel will not generate.
		If you want to caculate read latency distribution, the csv file must contain DATA event, otherwise the excel will not generate.

	b. groups for generating script
		config for cypress script:
			pattern_type=0					#0 random data, 1 user pattern, 2 int increase, 3 int decrease, 4 from log
			pattern_data="UserPatternData"	#user data pattern.
			pattern_len=15					#user pattern data len
			start_value=100					#use for int inc or int dec
			block_size=512
			max_sectors=128					#max sectors per request, if biger than this value it will be divided to several requests. 
			host_io=1						#1 1bit, 4 4bit, 8 8bit
			data_rate=0						#0 sdr, 1 ddr
			init_clk=2000					#init state clock
			usr_clk=40000					#user space clock,it will use this clock after enter transfer mode and change bus mode. 
			self_div=1						#0, divided it by this parser tool, 1 divided it use LargeRW command.
			comp_mask=320					#0x140 command response compare mask.
			curr_state=0					#0 idle, 1 ready, 2 ident, 3 stby, 4 tran, 5 data, 6 btst, 7 rcv, 8 prg, 9 dis, 10 ina, 11 slp, 12 irq, only 0 and 4 is used for select clock.
			comp_filt=1						#0 not filt, 1 filt, bit0 resp crc error
			cmd_filt=3						#0 not filt, 1 filt, bit0 filt illegal cmd between cmd0 and cmd1, bit1 filt no response cmd, bit2 filt bus_test cmd, bit3 filt tuning cmd
		config for simulator script:
			map_reset=0						#0 unmap reset command,1 map cmd1 to power reset cmd
			erase_sectors=32768				#sector base, 32768*512=16M
			show_id=1						#1 show event_id, 0 show test cycle
4. Output files:
	a. log.txt contains debug info.

	b. Excels will be generated in out directory.
		There are 6 kinds of excels available:
	    xxx_addr_dist.xlsx represents "Address Distribution".
	    xxx_cmd_dist.xlsx represents "Command Distribution".
	    xxx_delay_dist.xlsx represents "Busy/Latency Distribution".
	    xxx_idle_dist.xlsx represents "Request Idle Distribution".
	    xxx_sector_dist.xlsx represents "Sector Distribution".
	    xxx_seq_throughput.xlsx represents "Sequential Throughput", there are two series in one chart, the blue serie represents Max Busy/Latency Time for the request, and the red serie represents the Average Throughput(transfer time per sector) of the request.

		note:
		1). xxx_addr_dist.xlsx, xxx_cmd_dist.xlsx and xxx_sector_dist.xlsx will be generated for every csv.
		2). xxx_delay_dist.xlsx and xxx_seq_throughput.xlsx will be generated only for csv which has DATA or BUSY info (read command needs DATA info, write command needs BUSY info).
		3). xxx_idle_dist.xlsx will be generated only for csv which has both DATA and BUSY info.
		4). Csv file may contain error infos, so the corresponding excels may has errors too.
		5). For simulator user partation part script will be generate only.

	c. script file and bin files for write will be generated in result directory

5. Current support features:
	a. generate "Busy/Latency Distribution" excel, including cmd25, cmd24, cmd18, cmd17, cmd6
	b. generate "Command Distribution" excel
	c. generate "Sector Distribution" excel, including cmd25, cmd18
	d. generate "Address Distribution" excel, including cmd25, cmd18
	e. generate "Request Idle Distribution" excel
	f. generate "Seq Throughput" excel, including cmd25, cmd24, cmd18, cmd17
	g. generate cypress script files.
	h. generate simulator script files.
